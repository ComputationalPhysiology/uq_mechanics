### Code for uncertainty quantification in cardiac mechanics, based on Chaospy and a simplified version of Pulse

## References:

## Status:
In development, being updated from Python 2 to Python3. Code is currently not fully functional.
Mostly working, but not well tested:
* UQ with simple scalar parameters, both PCE and MC

Not currently working:
* Random fields based on KLE representation. Code using fiberrules needs some refactoring and fixes
